Hey, this is a little ahk macro that will spam m1 (left click) when you hold down the left mouse button.
it uses autohotkey v1 so if you don't have that installed feel free to install it [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

if you don't like the key bind i set or want to change anything about it feel free but i won't provide any support besides
the comments in my code.
